# read file 'sp500_ohlc.csv'
# add the column 'H-L' that is equal to (High-Low)
# describe the sample
# get the correlation & Covariance
# do a specific correlation just for those columns: 'Volume','H-L'
# what do you think of the results ?

# Tools:
# pandas.read_csv('filename', index_col = on_date, parse_dates=True)
# df.describe()
# df.corr()
# df.cov()


# Bonus question, make a visualization out of this.
# I'll be very impressed <3
